# Contents
This folder includes the complete answers to:

- **All labs**

- **All assignments**

- **Most of the Coding Exercises from the Lectures**: This section is the least organized, so check it out only if you're looking for something specific. Note that there are also non-coding exercises in the lectures that aren't included here, along with coding exercises where the code is revealed later in the lesson, which are mostly not included. Also, Lecture 34 is also not included.


## How to use
Each of the three main sections (Labs, Assignments, Lecture Exercises) is contained within its own IntelliJ project. Each lab/assignment/lecture is in a seperate package, and some of those are divided further into packages when appropriate.
So, you can:

- **View the code** By navigating to the appropriate folder. For example, the code for the second problem in assignment 2 is at: `./assignments/src/assignment2/problem2`

- **Run the code**: Open the appropriate project in Intellij and use the designated run configuration for each exercise.


## Also included
- **syllabus.md**: The course syllabus, reformatted for readability. You can find the original [here](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2510sp22/Syllabus.html).

- **formatting.xml**: The code formatting configuration used in the course, created in Eclipse and exported for your convenience. You can import it into your IDE of choice.
